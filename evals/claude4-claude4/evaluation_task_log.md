## **Error Analysis & Problem Solving**

### **Error Patterns**
1. **XML Validation Errors**: Multiple schema validation errors during development (expected in IDE environment)
2. **Critical Test Data Issue**: Systematic failure across all test methods due to single picklist validation
3. **Missing Components**: Permission sets not created despite being required

### **Error Frequency**
- **Test Data Errors**: 25 identical failures (100% of test methods)
- **XML Validation**: ~15 expected validation errors during development
- **Deployment Errors**: 0 (perfect deployment success rate)

### **Debugging Efficiency**
- **Problem Identification**: Quick identification of root cause (picklist values)
- **Resolution Attempts**: Multiple debugging cycles attempted
- **Success Rate**: High for deployment issues (100%), low for test validation (0%)
- **Most Effective Strategy**: Component-by-component deployment approach
