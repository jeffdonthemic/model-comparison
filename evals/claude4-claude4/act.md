# Purchasing and Inventory System - Implementation Results

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Salesforce purchasing and inventory management system for a commercial baking company.

## âœ… Successfully Deployed Components

### Data Model
1. **Purchase_Order__c** - Custom object with auto-number naming
   - `Approved__c` (Checkbox) - Controls approval workflow
   - `Status__c` (Picklist) - Draft, Submitted, Approved, Partially Received, Received
   - `Order_Date__c` (Date) - Required field for order tracking
   - `Expected_Delivery_Date__c` (Date) - Optional delivery planning
   - `Total_Amount__c` (Currency) - Financial tracking
   - `Notes__c` (Long Text Area) - Additional order information
   - `Supplier__c` (Lookup to Account) - Required supplier relationship

2. **Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c** - Child object with Master-Detail relationship
   - `Purchase_Order__c` (Master-Detail) - Parent relationship
   - `Ingredient__c` (Lookup to Ingredient__c) - Required ingredient reference
   - `Quantity_Ordered__c` (Number) - Required quantity tracking
   - `Quantity_Received__c` (Number) - Receiving tracking with default 0
   - `Unit_Cost__c` (Currency) - Cost per unit
   - `Line_Total__c` (Formula) - Calculated as Quantity_Ordered__c * Unit_Cost__c

3. **Ingredient__c** - Enhanced existing object
   - `In_Stock__c` (Number) - Current inventory levels
   - `On_Order__c` (Number) - Quantities on order
   - Additional existing fields: Category, Cost per Unit, Description, Unit of Purchase

### Business Logic (Apex Triggers)
1. **PurchaseOrderTrigger** with **PurchaseOrderTriggerHandler**
   - Auto-updates Status to "Approved" when Approved checkbox is checked
   - Validates that Status can only be changed to "Submitted" if Approved = true
   - Updates ingredient On_Order quantities when PO status changes to "Submitted"
   - Bulkified logic with proper exception handling

2. **PurchaseOrderLineItemTrigger** with **PurchaseOrderLineItemTriggerHandler**
   - Handles quantity received changes with delta calculations
   - Updates ingredient In_Stock and On_Order quantities automatically
   - Recalculates Purchase Order status based on received quantities:
     - "Partially Received" when some items received but not all
     - "Received" when all ordered quantities are received
   - Bulkified logic with recursive prevention

### Lightning Web Component
1. **purchaseOrderReceiving** - Complete receiving interface
   - Accepts Purchase Order ID parameter
   - Displays Purchase Order information (number, supplier, status)
   - Shows related line items in editable data table
   - Validates quantity received cannot exceed quantity ordered
   - Validates quantity received cannot be negative
   - Bulk update capability with success/error messaging
   - Proper loading states and error handling

2. **PurchaseOrderReceivingController** - Apex controller
   - `getPurchaseOrderWithLineItems()` - Cacheable method to load data
   - `updateLineItemQuantities()` - Handles bulk updates with validation
   - Proper security enforcement with `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED`
   - Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly messages

### User Interface
1. **Purchasing Management Lightning App**
   - Purchase Orders tab
   - Purchase Order Line Items tab
   - Ingredients tab
   - Suppliers tab (standard Account)
   - PO Receiving tab (custom Lightning Web Component)

2. **Custom Tabs**
   - Purchase_Order__c tab with clipboard icon
   - Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c tab with list icon
   - PO_Receiving tab with truck icon for receiving functionality

3. **FlexiPage**
   - PO_Receiving_Page - Hosts the purchaseOrderReceiving component

### Security & Permissions
1. **Admin Profile Updates**
   - Full access to all custom objects and fields
   - Tab visibility for all purchasing-related tabs
   - Field-level security configured

2. **Object Permissions**
   - Purchase_Order__c: Full CRUD access for admins
   - Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c: Full CRUD access for admins
   - Ingredient__c: Enhanced with new field permissions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Field Relationships
- **Lookup Relationships**: Configured with "Restrict" delete constraint
- **Master-Detail**: Proper parent-child relationship with controlled sharing
- **Formula Fields**: Automatic calculations for line totals

### Trigger Architecture
- **One Trigger Per Object** pattern implemented
- **Handler Classes** for separation of concerns
- **Bulkified Logic** for handling large data volumes
- **Recursive Prevention** using static boolean flags
- **Exception Handling** with proper error logging

### Lightning Web Component Features
- **Wire Services** for reactive data loading
- **Lightning Data Service** integration
- **Custom Apex Methods** for complex operations
- **Client-side Validation** with server-side enforcement
- **Toast Notifications** for user feedback
- **Loading States** for better user experience

### Data Integrity
- **Required Fields** properly configured
- **Default Values** set where appropriate
- **Validation Rules** enforced through triggers
- **Field-Level Security** implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Logic Implementation

### Purchase Order Workflow
1. **Draft** â†’ User creates PO with line items
2. **Approved** â†’ Admin checks Approved checkbox (auto-updates status)
3. **Submitted** â†’ Status can be manually changed (only if approved)
   - Automatically updates ingredient On_Order quantities
4. **Partially Received** â†’ Some quantities received via receiving component
5. **Received** â†’ All quantities fully received

### Inventory Management
- **Real-time Updates**: Ingredient quantities updated automatically
- **Delta Calculations**: Proper handling of quantity changes
- **Stock Tracking**: In_Stock increases, On_Order decreases during receiving
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple line item updates

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status
- **Status**: âœ… SUCCESSFUL
- **Components Deployed**: 35/35 (100%)
- **Errors**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Recommendations
1. Create test Purchase Orders with multiple line items
2. Test approval workflow and status transitions
3. Verify inventory quantity updates during receiving
4. Test validation rules (cannot receive more than ordered)
5. Test bulk receiving operations
6. Verify trigger bulkification with large data sets

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes
- Application configured for admin-only access initially
- All custom objects use proper sharing models
- Field-level security enforced
- SOQL queries use security enforcement
- No guest or community access configured

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Approval processes (per requirements - simple checkbox used instead)
- Minimum stock levels/reorder points (per requirements)
- Cost tracking/price history (per requirements)
- Multi-location support (per requirements)
- ERP/accounting system integration (per requirements)
