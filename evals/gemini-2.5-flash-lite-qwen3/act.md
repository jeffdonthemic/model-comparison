## Deployment Issues

1. **FlexiPage Conflict**: The deployment failed due to an issue with the Purchasing_UtilityBar flexipage. The error message indicates "You can't change a Lightning page's type." This suggests there may be an existing flexipage in the org with the same name but a different type.

2. **Profile Conflict**: There was a conflict with the Admin profile during deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the flexipage conflict by either:
   - Deleting the existing Purchasing_UtilityBar flexipage from the org
   - Renaming the flexipage in the source code
   - Modifying the flexipage type to match the existing one

2. Address the profile conflict by:
   - Using the --ignore-conflicts flag for profile deployment
   - Or retrieving the latest profile from the org and merging changes

3. Redeploy the remaining components after resolving the conflicts.

4. Fix the remaining test issue:
   - One test is failing due to a "Duplicate id in list" error in PurchaseOrderLineItemTriggerHandler.cls
   - This occurs when updating multiple line items that reference the same ingredient
   - Need to modify the handler to properly handle bulk updates without duplicate IDs

5. Run tests and check code coverage:
   - Apex unit tests have been created for all business logic (6 out of 7 tests currently passing)
   - Jest tests have been created for the LWC
   - Deploy tests using: `sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes/`
   - Run tests using: `sf apex run test --test-level RunLocalTests`
   - Check code coverage using: `sf org display limits`

## Business Logic Implementation

The core business logic has been implemented through Apex triggers and classes:

- Purchase order approval workflow (Approved__c checkbox updates Status__c)
- Status validation (can only set to "Submitted" when Approved__c is true)
- Inventory tracking (On_Order__c updates when PO is submitted)
- Receipt processing (Quantity_Received__c updates In_Stock__c and On_Order__c)
- Automatic status updates based on receipt quantities

## Security

The Purchasing_Admin permission set has been created with appropriate access to all custom objects, fields, and Apex classes.

## User Interface

The receivePurchaseOrder Lightning Web Component has been deployed and is ready for use on Purchase Order record pages.

## Testing

Unit tests have been created for all Apex classes and triggers:
- PurchaseOrderTriggerHandlerTest.cls - Tests for purchase order approval and submission logic (4 tests passing)
- PurchaseOrderLineItemTriggerHandlerTest.cls - Tests for line item receipt processing and status updates (2 tests passing, 1 failing)

**Latest Test Results:**
- Tests Ran: 7
- Pass Rate: 86% (6 passed)
- Fail Rate: 14% (1 failed)
- Failed Test: `PurchaseOrderLineItemTriggerHandlerTest.testPOStatusUpdatedToReceived`
- Failure Reason: "Duplicate id in list" error when updating multiple line items referencing the same ingredient

Jest tests have been created for the LWC:
- receivePurchaseOrder.test.js - Tests for component rendering and basic functionality

To run the tests:
1. Deploy the test classes: `sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes/`
2. Run all tests: `sf apex run test --test-level RunLocalTests`
3. Check code coverage: `sf org display limits`
