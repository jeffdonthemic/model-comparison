Eval Run ID: qwen2.5-gpt-4o-mini
Plan Model: Qwen Coder 2.5
Act Model: GPT 4o mini

You are to generate a complete Salesforce application that implements a purchasing and inventory system for a **commercial baking company**. After reviewing the instructions, analyze the current org structure in the local file system. Ask me any clarifying questions.

Before starting the application build process, create a new ./plan.md file and write the details of your plan to this file.

When completely finished with the application building process, it if was successfully completed or not, create a new ./act.md file with the details of what was built, including what was successful and/or not.

---

## üß± Objects

Implement the following Salesforce data model:

1. **Purchase_Order__c**  
2. **Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c**  
   - Child of Purchase_Order__c  
3. **Ingredient__c**
4. Use the standard **Account** object for suppliers

---

## üß© Fields to Include

### üîπ Purchase_Order__c
- `Approved__c` (Checkbox)
- `Status__c` (Picklist) with values:
  - `Draft`
  - `Submitted`
  - `Approved`
  - `Partially Received`
  - `Received`

### üîπ Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c
- `Quantity_Ordered__c` (Number)
- `Quantity_Received__c` (Number)

### üîπ Ingredient__c
- `In_Stock__c` (Number)
- `On_Order__c` (Number)

> In addition, include any other **standard purchasing fields** used in industry (e.g., Unit Cost, Notes, Expected Delivery Date).

---

## üîÅ Business Logic

1. When `Approved__c` is checked on a Purchase Order, automatically update `Status__c` to `"Approved"`.

2. A user can only manually change `Status__c` to `"Submitted"` if `Approved__c = TRUE`.

3. When a Purchase Order is set to `"Submitted"`:
   - For each related Line Item:
     - Find the associated Ingredient__c
     - Increase `On_Order__c` by `Quantity_Ordered__c`

4. When a Line Item‚Äôs `Quantity_Received__c` is changed:
   - Calculate the **delta** between new and old value
   - Update the related Ingredient__c:
     - Increment `In_Stock__c` by the delta
     - Decrease `On_Order__c` by the delta

5. After all updates:
   - If any line has `Quantity_Received__c > 0` and totals don't match ‚Üí `Status__c = "Partially Received"`
   - If total received equals total ordered ‚Üí `Status__c = "Received"`


- No Supplier management functionality
- No approval processes. Use the simple `Approved__c` checkbox
- No minimun stock levels or reorder points for ingredients.
- No cost tracking
- No multi-locations
- No integrations with other systems, including ERP or accounting systems

---

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface

1. Only Admins should be able to manage Purchase Orders and Line Items via the **standard Salesforce UI**. 

2. Create a **Lightning Web Component** that:
   - Accepts a Purchase Order ID
   - Loads its related Line Items
   - Provides input fields to update `Quantity_Received__c`
   - Validates: cannot receive more than `Quantity_Ordered__c`
   - On submit:
     - Apply updates
     - Trigger all relevant logic
     - Display success/error messages

---

## üîí Security

- Application is **admin-only** initially.
- Set permissions accordingly (profile/permset).
- No guest, community, or portal access.

---

## üß≠ App Shell

Create a **Lightning App** with tabs for:

- Purchase Orders  
- Purchase Order Line Items  
- Ingredients  
- Suppliers (Accounts)  
- The custom Lightning Web Component  

---

## üì¶ Deployment & Testing

- Deploy the complete application to the scratch org
- Once the application is successfully deployed, create any needed Apex or Jest tests
- Deploy the tests and run them for code coverage. Report code coverage. 

## üõë Constraints

- ‚ùå Do **not** generate Apex tests or Jest tests until after the application is successfully deployed
- ‚ùå Do **not** assume any managed packages
- ‚úÖ Follow Salesforce DX project structure

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Output

A deployed Salesforce application that includes:

- All metadata for objects, fields, automation, and UI
- A working Lightning Web Component
- No hallucinated fields or APIs
- Logic grounded in Salesforce platform behavior

# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Based on the provided task and the current org structure, I will start by creating a plan that outlines the steps needed to build the purchasing and inventory system for the commercial baking company. The plan will include the creation of objects, fields, automation, and the Lightning Web Component. I will also ensure that the security settings are correctly configured.

Given the current structure of the project, I will start by creating the necessary metadata files for the objects and fields. I will then proceed to implement the business logic using Apex triggers and classes. Finally, I will create the Lightning Web Component and the Lightning App.

I will document the plan in a `./plan.md` file and then proceed to the implementation phase once the plan is reviewed and approved.
