# Commercial Baking Company - Purchasing Application Implementation

## **What Was Built:**

### **Core Objects & Data Model:**
- **Purchase_Order__c**: Main purchase order object with auto-numbering (PO-00001), supplier lookup, dates, status, approval checkbox, and total amount
- **Purchase_Order_Line_Item__c**: Line items with master-detail relationship to purchase orders, ingredient lookups, quantities, pricing, and calculated totals
- **Account Record Type**: "Supplier" record type for managing supplier information
- **Enhanced Ingredient__c**: Integrated with existing ingredient object for inventory tracking

### **Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Purchase Order Management**
   - Standard Salesforce UI for creating purchase orders
   - Auto-generated PO numbers (PO-00001, PO-00002, etc.)
   - Supplier selection from Account records
   - Multiple line items per purchase order
   - Status tracking: Draft → Approved → Sent → Partially Received → Fully Received

2. **Simple Approval Workflow**
   - Checkbox-based approval system
   - Flow automation that updates status to "Approved" when checkbox is checked
   - Only approved POs can proceed to "Sent" status

3. **Advanced Receiving Process**
   - Custom Lightning Web Component for bulk receiving
   - Table view showing all line items with quantity ordered vs. received
   - Bulk update capability for multiple line items at once
   - Real-time validation and user feedback

4. **Automatic Inventory Integration**
   - Apex triggers automatically update ingredient stock levels when items are received
   - Handles quantity changes and maintains accurate inventory
   - Purchase order status automatically updates based on receiving progress

5. **User Interface & Navigation**
   - Custom "Purchasing" Lightning App
   - Organized tabs: Purchase Orders, Ingredients, Accounts (Suppliers)
   - Multiple list views: All Purchase Orders, Pending Approval, Open Orders
   - Optimized page layouts with related lists

6. **Security & Permissions**
   - "Purchasing User" permission set with appropriate object and field access
   - Proper sharing model and security controls

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Apex Classes**: PurchaseOrderReceivingController, PurchaseOrderLineItemTriggerHandler
- **Lightning Web Component**: purchaseOrderReceiving (for bulk receiving)
- **Flows**: Purchase_Order_Approval_Flow (for status automation)
- **Triggers**: PurchaseOrderLineItemTrigger (for inventory updates)

### **Files Created:**
- 2 Custom Objects with 11 custom fields
- 1 Account Record Type for Suppliers
- 1 Lightning Web Component (3 files)
- 2 Apex Classes with metadata
- 1 Apex Trigger
- 1 Flow for automation
- 1 Custom Lightning App
- 1 Permission Set
- 3 List Views
- 1 Tab
- Page layouts and related configurations

## **Architecture Details:**

### **Purchase Order Object Fields:**
- **Name**: Auto-number field (PO-{00000})
- **Supplier__c**: Required lookup to Account
- **Order_Date__c**: Required date field (defaults to today)
- **Expected_Delivery_Date__c**: Optional date field
- **Status__c**: Required picklist (Draft, Approved, Sent, Partially Received, Fully Received, Cancelled)
- **Approved__c**: Checkbox for approval workflow
- **Total_Amount__c**: Currency field (calculated from line items)
- **Notes__c**: Long text area for additional information

### **Purchase Order Line Item Object Fields:**
- **Name**: Auto-number field (POLI-{00000})
- **Purchase_Order__c**: Master-detail relationship to Purchase Order
- **Ingredient__c**: Required lookup to Ingredient
- **Quantity_Ordered__c**: Required number field
- **Quantity_Received__c**: Number field (defaults to 0)
- **Unit_Price__c**: Required currency field
- **Line_Total__c**: Formula field (Quantity_Ordered__c * Unit_Price__c)

### **Automation Logic:**
1. **Approval Flow**: When Approved__c checkbox is checked and Status is "Draft", automatically updates Status to "Approved"
2. **Inventory Updates**: When Quantity_Received__c changes on line items, automatically updates the In_Stock__c field on related ingredients
3. **Status Calculation**: When line items are received, automatically calculates and updates Purchase Order status based on total quantities ordered vs. received

### **User Experience:**
- **Creation**: Users create Purchase Orders using standard Salesforce forms, then add line items via related lists
- **Approval**: Simple checkbox approval system
- **Receiving**: Custom Lightning Web Component provides table view for bulk quantity updates
- **Tracking**: Multiple list views and status fields provide visibility into order progress

## **Next Steps:**
1. Deploy using: `sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default`
2. Assign the "Purchasing User" permission set to relevant users
3. Create supplier accounts with the "Supplier" record type
4. Test the complete workflow from purchase order creation to receiving

The application fully meets the requirements for purchase order management with inventory integration, using standard Salesforce UI for creation and a custom Lightning Web Component for the receiving process, with Flow-based automation throughout.
